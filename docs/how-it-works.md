# How it Works

HyperWarp is a non-custodial marketplace designed to unlock liquidity for vote-escrowed NFTs (veNFTs). Users can:

- List their veKitten NFTs using **Fixed Price** or **Dutch Auction**
- Purchase listings with a simple onchain transaction
- Use the dApp to manage listings, offers, and wallet permissions

**Users retain custody of their NFTs and tokens at all times** â€” until a sale is completed. The protocol only requires an **approval allowance** to the HyperWarp marketplace contract for an individual NFT when creating listings or offers, ensuring **trustless, non-custodial** interactions.

*Sales can be canceled any time before purchased*
