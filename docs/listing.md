There are two types of listing that can be created by sellers. 

<Tip>Sales are non-custodial - you keep your veNFT until sold. If you vote after listing, it becomes unpurchasable until voting ends. Cancel or relist your sale anytime.</Tip>

## Types of Listings

### Fixed Price Listing

Sell your veNFT at a set price in **Native Token**.

- **Example**: List for `5,000 Kitten`
- Appears in marketplace until bought or cancelled.

### Dutch Auction

Set a **starting price** and a **minimum price**, and it decreases over time.

- **Example**: Start at `10,000 Kitten`, drop to `5,000 Kitten` over 48 hours
- Encourages quick bidding and price discovery.


<Danger>IMPORTANT: The price you set for the veNFT is fixed. If you merge more tokens in to your veNFT the price will will NOT increase. You must cancel the sale and create a new one with the new price.</Danger>
