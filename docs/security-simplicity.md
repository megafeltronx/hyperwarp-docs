title: Security & Simplicity
---

HyperWarp prioritizes simplicity and safety by supporting only whitelisted assets:

- **NFTs:** Only `veKitten` is currently supported  
- **Tokens:** Listings are priced in **Kitten** or **wHYPE**, depending on seller preference

By restricting tradable assets, the marketplace reduces attack surfaces and keeps its pricing logic straightforward. 
<Danger>However, sellers choosing to list in **wHYPE** must understand the implications of volatility.</Danger>

### Why Volatile Tokens Carry Risk

Let's break it down with a real example:

| Scenario              | 1 wHYPE = $40 | 1 veKitten = $1 | Listing = 10,000 veKitten for 250 wHYPE |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **At Listing Time**   | 250 wHYPE Ã— $40 = $10,000 | Fair Market Value | â†’ A fair deal                          |
| **wHYPE Drops to $20**| 250 wHYPE Ã— $20 = $5,000  | â†’ Buyer gets a 50% discount             |
| **wHYPE Pumps to $60**| 250 wHYPE Ã— $60 = $15,000 | â†’ Buyer overpays by 50%                 |

### ðŸª™ Comparison Table

| Pricing Token | Market Movement   | Buyer Pays (USD) | Outcome                      |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Kitten**    | Any               | $10,000          | Stable, predictable pricing  |
| **wHYPE**     | Drops to $20      | $5,000           | Buyer gets 50% discount      |
| **wHYPE**     | Rises to $60      | $15,000          | Buyer overpays by 50%        |

<Tip>*By listing everything in **Kitten**, the price is stable within the protocol, both buyers and sellers know exactly what to expect â€” no surprise discounts, no accidental overpays.*</Tip>

**Takeaway:**  
Pricing in **Kitten** offers consistency and eliminates guesswork. **wHYPE** provides flexibility â€” but introduces volatility risks. Sellers should consider what best fits their strategy before listing.
